  <p>A list of the {{ total }} models of computer, peripheral or service in the collection, grouped by company name. Note that some model names 
  have been merged for convenience, for example TI-99/4 and TI-99/4A, whilst some have been 
  split where they are known by multiple distinct names, e.g. Atari's VCS which later on became 
  known as the Atari 2600.</p>
