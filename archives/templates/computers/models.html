  <p>Models of computer or peripheral, grouped by company name. Note that some model names 
  have been merged for convenience, for example TI-99/4 and TI-99/4A, whilst some have been 
  split where they are know by multiple distinct names, e.g. Atari's VCS which became the 2600. 
  Also note that some adverts contain products from other companies, so for instance you will 
  see the BBC Micro appear under Torch, as well as Acorn.</p>
